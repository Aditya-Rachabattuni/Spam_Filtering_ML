Spam Filtering using Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
This project is a machine learning application for spam detection that classifies text messages as spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and an SVM classifier to achieve reliable text classification.

Project Overview
Purpose: To filter spam messages and improve communication by identifying unwanted content.
Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit.
ML Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
Features
Real-Time Spam Detection: Allows users to input text messages and instantly receive a spam or ham classification.
Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit for an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
High Accuracy: Utilizes NLP techniques and SVM to achieve a high accuracy rate in spam detection.
